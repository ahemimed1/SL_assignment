# SL Assignment – JavaScript Source Code

## Important Note for the Instructor

Dear Instructor,

I encountered a technical problem when trying to submit this assignment by email.

When attaching the **JavaScript (.js) files** to the email, the email service automatically blocks them and displays a warning indicating that the files may contain a virus. This happens even though the files are **pure JavaScript source code** and do not contain any malicious content.

Because of this limitation, I was unable to send the `.js` files via email.

## Alternative Submission Method (GitHub)

To ensure you can access the full and original source code without any alteration, I have uploaded the complete assignment to a GitHub repository.

🔗 **GitHub Repository Link:**  
https://github.com/ahemimed1/SL_assignment.git

All required files, including JavaScript source files, are available in this repository.

Thank you for your understanding.
